# About me

Hi there, I'm Ling (He/His)

- 🏫 My formal background is in Quantitative Economics and Statistics
- 🔭 Currently enjoying holiday before working as a data scientist
- 🌱 I hope to explore more on applying Bayesian statistics and advanced deep learning methods (GAN, Autoencoder, RL) to solve "traditional" business problems, please contact me if you are interested in these topics too!
- 💬 I'm open for conversations on applying machine learning and data science methods in economics (including business) and statistics field
- 📫 You can reach me at lingjie@u.nus.edu

My **workflow** revolves around SSH-ing from
MacOS to Ubuntu server, using Tmux and Neovim.
You might find my
[*config*](https://github.com/lingjie00/cli_settings)
interesting if you are interested in my workflow.

Setting up new repository for data science work is
troublesome, I have a
[*template*](https://github.com/lingjie00/template)
built with cookiecutter to simplify the process.

Juniors who are looking for relevant academic
and data science materials might be interested in
my past
[*cheatsheet*](https://github.com/lingjie00/NUS_cheatsheet)
and
[*projects*](https://github.com/lingjie00/projects)
I did when I first started learning data science.
If you are interested in joining the data science field,
please feel free to contact me.
